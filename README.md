Hey - making this site ([source](https://github.com/1man1inch/lockdown_skeptic_FAQ)) in response to a couple of really interesting posts I saw today: 
1. https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/l1fzyl/anti_scepticism_faq_site/
2. https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/l154c7/is_there_any_way_to_get_engagement_with/
3. https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/l0qtjz/hi_i_am_monica_gandhi_infectious_diseases/

The first post linked to a frustrating, but fairly impressive anti-anti-lockdown site.  As I read thru it - I found myself unable to argue against the majority of the pts.  Additionally - I found the format and presentation really good - and more useful in an argument than our own wiki which largely links to other sites where u might do your own research.  The primary goal of this repo is to present an echo of that site from a lockdown-skeptic perspective.  Maybe also to serve as a kind of cheatsheet. 

The 2nd post was a genral Q about involving some pro-lockdown voices in our discussions, possibly also doing some AMAs.  Having a clean looking website to summarize our ideas might make people like that more willing to engage w/ us - and I think it would also help frame the discussion.  It got me thinking tho - sometimes I get the impression that the format of reddit lends itself to treading water.   Dont u guys ever get severe de-ja vu browsing our sub? - I mean - all the posts and comments are just rehashes of stuff Ive seen before.  It makes it so that we are just passive and observing whats happening through the news we love to hate.  Which is not to say  there isnt stuff I found really interresting and worth preserving  - e.g. there was some link to a takedown of the flaxman [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7) where the methodology is torn apart.  That should be on this site!  We could even update the section to reflect the ongoing review process!  Instead its buried somewhere in reddit's infinite scroll.

The 3rd post  was an AMA from a UCSF prof .  The mods did a fantastic job collating and organizing the AMA, but I worry that the great info in there is not linked to a broader context in a way thats accessible.  Same goes for the AMA w/ https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jvtpwz/ask_me_anything_sunetra_gupta/ .  I think the more AMAs we do the more we run the risk of asking the same Qs over and over again.  But - if we were to have this site as a starting pt we could start to use expert voices to advance the discussion and refine our ideas, which I think is a much better use of expertise.

Anyways - w.r.t the format (and domain name) definitely open to change.  The site mentioned in the first post used some stupid framework thats basically a glorified markdown editor - so I thought why not write this in markdown?  See - u can link to other pages like [so](./poc_link.md).  But... I could see some sub members unsure of how to contribute to a project like this so am open to suggestions.

Finally - personally Im interested in looking into the flaxman paper mentioned earlier and writing something.  But we would need some community collaboration to get this site to a point where we should feel comfortable sharing it.  If u are interested in contributing - add a link to ur github profile to the list below (like I did).  I think we should have about 10 contributors to this site total, so lets aim for a sign up list of 20.  Unless you really really just need to touch pen to paper I wouldnt start any work until we reach that limit. 

#### NOTE:
Be careful about doxxing - dont use or contribute w/ ur personal github or an accnt that could be linked to you.
